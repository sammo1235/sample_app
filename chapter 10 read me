Users can be updated using an edit form, which sends a PATCH request to the update action.
Safe updating through the web is enforced using strong parameters.
Before filters give a standard way to run methods before particular controller actions.
We implement an authorization using before filters.
Authorization tests use both low-level commands to submit particular HTTP requests directly to controller actions and high-level integration tests.
Friendly forwarding redirects users where they wanted to go after logging in.
The users index page shows all users, one page at a time.
Rails uses the standard file db/seeds.rb to seed the database with sample data using rails db:seed.
Running render @users automatically calls the _user.html.erb partial on each user in the collection.
A boolean attribute called admin on the User model automatically creates an admin? boolean method on user objects.
Admins can delete users through the web by clicking on delete links that issue DELETE requests to the Users controller destroy action.
We can create a large number of test users using embedded Ruby inside fixtures.
