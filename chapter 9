9.4.1 What we learned in this chapter

#    Rails can maintain state from one page to the next using persistent cookies
      via the cookies method.

#    We associate to each user a remember token and a corresponding remember
      digest for use in persistent sessions.

#    Using the cookies method, we create a persistent session by placing a
      permanent remember token cookie on the browser.

#    Login status is determined by the presence of a current user based on the
      temporary session’s user id or the permanent session’s unique remember token.

#    The application signs users out by deleting the session’s user id and
      removing the permanent cookie from the browser.

#    The ternary operator is a compact way to write simple if-then statements.
